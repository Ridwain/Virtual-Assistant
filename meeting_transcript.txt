[00:48:39]  you

[00:49:06]  you
[00:55:02]  you
[00:55:10]  you
[00:56:33]  demo of how to do macOS audio routing.
[00:56:41]  A couple different things, but maybe the big one is how to set up black hole to capture your system audio.
[00:56:49]  So, as a quick demo before I even talk, you can hear my voice. That's coming in through this microphone.
[00:56:57]  You can hear my guitar. Uh... Uh... Sounds better.
[00:57:05]  because my cables over the strings, but you know, you get the idea. You can hear Grudge band.
[00:57:12]  And finally, you can hear audio from my sister.
[00:57:20]  Okay, so how do we do this? Well, first I'll start out by just explaining, you know, why did I want to do this? So the reason I want to do this,
[00:57:28]  wanted to do all of this, this specific setup. What I wanted to be able to do was record myself.
[00:57:36]  playing a solo over a backing track and then record myself watching that recording and kind of
[00:57:44]  analyzing the solo that I played and talk about what I was thinking and where I think it can improve and all that kind of stuff.
[01:00:26]  Different things you need to record. The easy ones are your microphone and your
[01:00:33]  guitar right so my microphone is this HyperX headset my guitar is coming in through the built-in audio
[01:00:41]  interface on my amp. And then the tricky one is the system audio because the system audio by default is a little bit more than the system audio.
[02:55:17]  $100,000. But if you can't, we will be done.
[02:55:25]  donating it to a charity for choice. You guys can do it! We got it! All right, it's now time! Here we go. Serena Sarina.
[02:55:33]  of say tennis ball faster than any woman on earth. So good luck, quadruplets.
[02:55:41]  Oh! You're living with us all, then! Oh, sorry! It's okay.
[02:55:49]  You killed us. I'm gonna send this to the Tundee Price Resource Center. So we're really excited about it. And what I'm really excited about is that we have Steph Curry.
[02:55:56]  and name are later in this video. All right now we have a 1v1 with a different festival all started. And for our next 1v1 we have
[02:56:04]  I'm Yannis, the Greek freak, a nine-time all-star, two-time MVP and NBA champion. Versus

[13:19:08] ğŸ–¥ [System]: ,
[13:19:12] ğŸ–¥ [System]: from my university.
[13:19:16] ğŸ–¥ [System]: My face is burning. What to do now?
[13:19:20] ğŸ–¥ [System]: out.
[13:19:24] ğŸ–¥ [System]: Hillary Celepine
[13:19:29] ğŸ–¥ [System]: Amen. Thank you very much.
[13:19:43] ğŸ–¥ [System]: I want to use the feature.
[13:19:47] ğŸ–¥ [System]: Please explain me, sir.
[13:19:51] ğŸ–¥ [System]: Hello.
[13:20:03] ğŸ–¥ [System]: Any pull up these balls?
[13:20:07] ğŸ–¥ [System]: I love you.
[13:20:15] ğŸ–¥ [System]: What time is it?
[13:20:19] ğŸ–¥ [System]: What is Multanimati?
[13:20:23] ğŸ–¥ [System]: What to do for my kidney problem?
[13:20:30] ğŸ–¥ [System]: Any problem?
[13:20:34] ğŸ–¥ [System]: I am
[13:20:38] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: Hey, then, what are you gonna write?
[13:20:54] ğŸ–¥ [System]: Thank you.
[13:20:58] ğŸ–¥ [System]: Bangalore, Bangalore is our country.
[13:21:06] ğŸ–¥ [System]: don't forget to subscribe to the channel
[16:39:30] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: Hello everyone, what are you doing?
[16:39:38] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: version of Whisper from OpenAI and yeah we are actually using our
[16:39:41] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: GPU here that's why we can get such low latency but the
[16:39:45] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: I am running on a kind of new 4 series and video so
[16:39:49] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: It's nothing insane but it's working pretty good. So this is very easy to do.
[16:39:53] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: to set up and we're gonna leave a link to the git tab here so just basically just taping so on.
[16:39:57] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: whisper and just follow the instructions here and you can have it.
[16:43:24] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: have this setup in no time. If you go back to our record you can see
[16:43:28] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: see we have a function that is actually recording from our microphone and creating
[16:43:32] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: trunks and here we can adjust the trunk length by a
[16:43:36] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: Yeah, we can set like one. I think that's one second.
[16:45:35] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: on the terminal right and faster
[16:45:39] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: whisper has of course all the models so we can have small mid
[16:45:43] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: We can have medium English, we can have large wheat.
[16:45:47] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: That's the best one and we can have all to detect language, I just said it.
[16:45:51] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: into English for now, right? And then we come into this
[16:45:55] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: true loop here that is actually taking what we are recording
[16:45:59] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: and it's printing it and it's accumulating this in two layers.
[16:46:03] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: like a long file too that we can actually when this
[16:46:07] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: breaks we can print the log here other than that is
[16:46:11] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: This is pretty simple, pretty straightforward, it's not a big script.
[16:46:15] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: You can see we are using QDACores here from my GPU.
[16:46:18] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: There's a few things you can adjust to make it even quicker.
[16:46:22] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: but I think we're just going to keep it as it is for now. I'm going to move on.
[16:46:26] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: to kind of our next use case. Like always, it's
[16:48:00] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: Hello everyone what are you doing?
[16:48:04] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: Are you good?
[16:48:08] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: Yes, I am good.
[16:48:12] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: Okay baby, okay.
[16:49:17] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: Hello everyone, what are you doing?
[16:49:21] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: Have fun!
[16:49:25] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: out of you.
[16:49:29] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: Thank you very much.
[16:49:33] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: No, no, no.
[16:49:37] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: What you are talking about.
[16:49:41] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: Okay.
[16:53:19] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: Support me other than that, just like the video. If you like this kind of content.
[16:53:23] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: and maybe leave a comment or something but yeah let's move on to
[16:53:27] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: another use case I created for this. Okay so the next is
[16:56:09] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: To sample is going to be a real-time sentiment analysis.
[16:56:12] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: So you can see we have a getchatteless response function here that uses GPT-4
[16:58:59] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: here we have something that is more of a sliding window because
[16:59:03] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: we always want to keep the prompt to a set number.
[16:59:07] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: of characters so this is going to be 100 characters that means that the
[16:59:11] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: from, it will always be 100 characters long and it changes.
[16:59:15] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: over time you will see how this works when we run it and recreate the last
[16:59:19] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: simply you are that it's actually it's gone out.
[17:00:05] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: Hello everyone what are you doing?
[17:00:13] ğŸ–¥ [System]: place the sentiment and yeah basically all is
[17:00:17] ğŸ–¥ [System]: the same you can see we have another prompt here so this
[17:00:21] ğŸ–¥ [System]: This takes the sliding window as an input.
[17:00:25] ğŸ–¥ [System]: What is the sentiment of the conversation above?
[17:00:29] ğŸ–¥ [System]: Thank you.
[17:00:33] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: I am okay, okay, okay.
[17:00:41] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: Okay, good, good.
[17:00:49] ğŸ‘¤ [Ridwain]: Nice, nice.
[17:00:53] ğŸ–¥ [System]: So
[17:00:56] ğŸ–¥ [System]: cancer only with positive, neutral or negative.
[17:01:00] ğŸ–¥ [System]: Yeah, kinda what this does is there it looks at what
[17:01:04] ğŸ–¥ [System]: is going on in the conversation now and gives sentiment on that.
